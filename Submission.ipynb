    "## Data description: ##\n",
    "The data comes from a talent sourcing and management company.  They are looking to automate searching and ranking potential candidates based on results from keyword searches of a database.  After an initial ranking, the goal is to star a particular candidate or set of candidates and use those entries to re-rank the candidates accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided data from search results are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "id = unique identifier for candidate (numeric)\n",
    "job_title = job title for candidate (text)\n",
    "location = geographical location for candidate (text)\n",
    "connections = number of connections candidate has, 500+ means over 500 (text)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is develop an empirical fit calculatuation which will be used to rank the candidates and then re-calculated upon any candidate being starred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical fit calculation ###\n",
    "An empirical fit calculation was employed which weights the candidate based on how their `job_title` and `location` matched the specified search term.  This was done by breaking the search term into all possible consecutive substrings and searching for the relative frequency of the substring in each candidate's `job_title` and `location`, relative to how frequently that substring appeared in all candidate's in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say the search string was `aspiring human resources`.  The following substrings would be searched:\n",
    "\n",
    "`aspiring`, `human`, `resources`, \n",
    "`aspiring human`, `human resources`, \n",
    "`aspiring human resources`\n",
    "\n",
    "For each one of those substrings, each candidate was ranked on whether they had that substring in their `job_title` or `location`.  The more exactly they matched that substring and how commone this substring appeared in all candidates both go into that ranking.  This used a Natural Language Processing technique known as Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "The rankings for each candidate for each substring are then summed and normalized.  This has the effect of the more exactly a candidate matches the search string, without additional descriptors in their `job_title` or `location` fields, the higher the fit score they receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starring and re-ranking ###\n",
    "After the initial rankings are generated, a specific `id` can be selected for starring.  This operation can be repeated multiple times, if it's desired to star multiple candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a candidate is starred, their `job_title` and `location` are used as the new search term (or one of multiple search terms each time an additional candidate is starred) and the empirical fit process is repeated.  This has the effect of increasing the fit score for all candidates who closely match the `job_title` and or `location` of the star or starred candidates.  Upon each new starring, more search terms are added and any candidate who best matches the combination of those search terms will rise in the rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example ####\n",
    "An example is carried out below, where the initial search term of `aspiring human resources` is used and initial rankings are generated showing many candidates with that exact string in their `job_title` as rising to the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `id=97` candidate is then starred, which changes the search term to match their `job_title` and `location` and it can be seen that now candidates who match `Aspiring Human Resources Professional` are more likely to appear higher in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `id=58` candidate is now starred, which reinforces the `Aspiring Human Resources Professional` title and now most of the top candidates have that in their `job_title` and some candidates in the `Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina Area` have risen up the list, matching `id=58`'s location.  Note that the top two candidates are `id=97` and `id=58` as well, as a result of them being starred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `id=18` candidate is starred, with a `job_title` of `People Development Coordinator at Ryan`, rearranging the candidates to reflect a mix of `Aspiring Human Resources Professional` and `People Development Coordinator at Ryan` at the top of the rankings."
